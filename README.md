## Business Case Overview  

The **Cardiff Festival Association** organizes concerts, theatre performances, dance shows, and other cultural events. Previously, tickets were sold exclusively in person at the Cardiff Library. To modernize operations, the association aims to launch a **web platform** where clients can view upcoming events and book tickets.  

### Key Requirements  

- **Online Ticket Booking:**  
  Clients receive a unique booking number and must purchase tickets at the library within three days.  

- **Event & Venue Management:**  
  Support for events in multiple venues with dynamic seating capacities.  

- **Artist Registry:**  
  Maintain contact details and special requirements for domestic and international performers.  

- **Booking Management:**  
  Allow ticket bookings, modifications, cancellations, and status updates upon payment.  

- **Financial and Performance Tracking:**  
  Support queries for ticket sales, event attendance, and artist performance statistics.  

The solution will streamline ticketing, improve client convenience, and enable better event and performance management for the Cardiff Festival Association.
